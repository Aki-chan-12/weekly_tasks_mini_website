    <h1>Week 2 Showcase</h1>
    <br>

    <p>This is the showcase for Week 2 weekly tasks.</p>
    <br>

    <p>For week 2 there were 2 tasks given:</p>

    <p>Task 1: Use hyperlinks in a creative/artistic context</p>
    <p>Create a mini-website that redirects in an infinite loop, or write a poem using hyperlinks, or create an archive for resources, or an interactive text-based game, or feel free to explore more creative potentials of hyperlinks. Think about how we can use hyperlinks as a tool for expression.</p>

    <p>You can link to additional resources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="additional_resource1.html" target="_blank">Click to see my song lyrics website</a></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Task 2: Create an mini website for your weekly works</p>
    <p>Create a mini website to showcase all your weekly works and create links.</p>

    <p><span style="color: red;">This website was specifically made to follow this task.</span></p>
