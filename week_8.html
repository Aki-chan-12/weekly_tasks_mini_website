    <h1>Week 8 Showcase</h1>
    <br>

    <p>This is the showcase for Week 8 weekly task.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Task: Create your own tiny internet corner, using Google Sheets as an API</p>

    <p>For example: It can be books you recommend, or music you'd like other people to listen to.
    Or it can be places to visit, or food to try in London
    Or it an also be parks to read a book
    Or any other information that you want to recommend to people
    Or maybe you can also create an open and collaborative project where people can also add their recommendations to your Sheet and build a collective recommendation list</p>
    <br>

    <p>Use Async/Await to fetch the API</p>

    <p>using forEach loop, create and append elements as needed on to the DOM
    Style the web page
    Add a link to to your spreadsheet at the bottom of your web page
    git add; git commit; git push; and upload it on cyberduck as well</p>
