    <h1>Week 9 Showcase</h1>
    <br>

    <p>This is the showcase for Week 9 weekly task.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Task: Create a webpage that tells a story as you scroll</p>

    <p>Add animations using parallax and/or IntersectionObserver
        <br>
    You can use text, images, buttons or any other content that adds value to your story.
    <br>
    Maybe you can have buttons that take you to a particular element on the screen.
    <br>
    Or maybe your story can be horizontal as well?
    <br>
    Hint: instead of translating Y positions, translate X position to play with elements on X-axis</p>
