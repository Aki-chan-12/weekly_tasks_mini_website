    <h1>Week 4 Showcase</h1>
    <br>

    <p>This is the showcase for Week 4 weekly tasks.</p>
    <br>

    <p>For this week we were given 4 tasks to do. So I have decided to integrate all of them into 1 code.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Task 1: Design your personal collection</p>

    <p>Using the links.html you created in the class as inspiration-
        Build your personal collection as a work in progress. Collect resources, inspiration, artists you admire, websites you like, designs you find interesting, or anything that you would to add to your personal inspiration library.
        Style your collection using CSS. Be creative. Add colours, margins, backgrounds, gradients, and experiment with the styles.
        Use an external font to style your text. (See:Libre Fonts by Womxn, and Google Fonts)</p>
        <br>

    <p>Task 2: Apply different hover styles to links</p>

    <p>On your personal collections page, apply different transition styles to different links so images, text, or icons change.
        See:https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp </p>
        <br>

    <p>Task 3: Contribute one or two links to the collective resources Padlet.</p>
    <p>Highlight a creative or conceptual approach that you find interesting. For example focus on a theme, playfulness, general tone or a technical feature that you find interesting. Connect the board to a relevant topic, or feel free to create your own.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Extended Task 4:</p>
    <p>Incorporate a CSS library (i.e. w3.css, Boostrap, Materialise) to set different link styles on your main index.html (home) page.
        See:https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks</p>
