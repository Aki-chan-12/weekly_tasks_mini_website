    <h1>Task 1</h1>

    <p>Short summary:</p>
    <p>I have decide to choose a topic - write a poem using hyperlinks</p>
    <p>BUT I wanted it more connected to me, so I have decided to write an opening song from one of my favourite animes.</p>
    <p>Anime name is Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan)</p>

    <p>The opening was made for the first part of the first season. I really wanted to connect it with my task, because I like this song a lot!</p>
